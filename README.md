An interactive online retail interface at the terminal with an item search where users can add products to their cart. Loosely coupled view and buy cart features.

Can be compilable with "make" and clean files with "make clean".

Tested with "./amazon filename.txt" if provided with seperate database that follows format.
Tested personally with "./amazon database.txt".
