An interactive online retail interface at the terminal with an item search where users can add products to their cart. Loosely coupled view and buy cart features.

Compilable with "make" and clean files with "make clean".
Ran and tested personally with "./amazon database.txt".

Run and test with "./amazon filename.txt" if provided with seperate database that follows format.
